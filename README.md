# movie-fight
A web app to compare two movies using movie data from the OMDb API (Open Movie Databse API).

The app consists of two side by side search bars that display a list of options in a dropdown when the user types in some part of of a movie name to search. The user can then select the movie they want. The key movie information is displayed for different categories. The user repeats the process with the next search bar for a movie they want to compare the first movie with and the movie that "wins" each category is highlighted
